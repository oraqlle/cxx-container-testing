# C++ Container Testing

A simple program that runs a series of tests on C++ standard containers. The tests are not designed to be rigorous but rather simple experimentation of the relative performance of C++ containers.

## Tests

The tests include:

- Push Back
- Push Front
- Linear Search
- Random Insert w/ Linear Search
- Destruction
- Sort
- Incremental Sorted Insert

The results of the tests are store in the [`data/`](./data) directory. Graphs of the data are stored in the [`images`](./images) directory.

Currently, only the following containers are tested.

- `std::vector`
- `std::deque`
- `std::list`

## Running Tests

To run the tests simply run the following command in the root of the project.

```sh
poac run -r
```
